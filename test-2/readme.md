# Test 2

In this test, you'll build a simple table that displays a list of users (found in `users.json`). You should be able to search through this table with a search box.

## Requirements

- This must be built either with React.js or React Native
- This is a single-page app. No navigation is expected
- Styling is not required. We will focus on your code and logic
- It's suggested to use MUI or any other React UI library for UI

## Expected behaviours

- Display table with the list of users. All data must be shown in the table.
- We should be able to filter through the list through a search box
